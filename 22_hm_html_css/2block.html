        <h1>What is FrontEnd?</h1>
        <p>
            In software engineering, the terms frontend and backend (or sometimes referred to as back end or back-end) 
            refer to the separation of concerns between the presentation layer (frontend), and the data access layer (backend)
            of a piece of software, or the physical infrastructure or hardware. In the client–server model, the client is usually
            considered the frontend and the server is usually considered the backend, even when some presentation work is actually
            done on the server itself.

        <p>
            Backend is the software and hardware part of the service. This is a set of tools by which the website
            logic is implemented. This is what is hidden from our eyes, that is, it happens outside the computer and browser. As soon 
            as you enter a query on the search engine page and press the "Enter" key, the frontend will end and the backend will begin. 
            Your request will be sent to the Yandex or Google server, i.e., to the location of the search algorithms. That's where all 
            the "magic" happens. But now, the data that you requested appears on the monitor - this is a return to the frontend.
